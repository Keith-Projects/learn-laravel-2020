# learn-laravel-2020
I am learning Laravel, and will be using this project to experiment.


I will be using composer to install Laravel with the following command:
composer create-project laravel/laravel learn-laravel-2020

I will be using laravel ui for the front-end with bootstrap:
composer require laravel/ui
bootstrap: php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
note: Since I will be taking advantage of the auth option, I will be installing bootstrap with the command above.
Now to install the bootstrap package and the related front-end dependencies, we will run the following:
npm install
Once that is complete, we need to run the command:
npm run dev
If we make any changes to any of these files, we will need to run npm run dev again.
